# Animate.css Tutorial

## Overview

This example demonstrates the use of the Animate.css library, a powerful tool for adding animations to elements on a webpage.

## Components

### index.html

This is the main HTML file for the website. It references the Animate.css library using a CDN link in the head section. The body contains a div with the class "box" that will be animated.

### style.css

This is the stylesheet for the webpage. It styles the .box class which is used in the index.html.

### animate.min.css

This is the Animate.css library. It is loaded into the index.html file via a CDN link. It's a collection of pre-set animations that can be used by adding the relevant classes to HTML elements.

### How it works

The `animate__animated` class is a general class added to elements that you want to animate.

The `animate__bounce` class is an example of a specific animation class from the Animate.css library. In this case, it causes the element to bounce.

You can find more animation classes in the official Animate.css documentation.
