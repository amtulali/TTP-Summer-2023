# Git/GitHub

## Meeting Process
- [Git/GitHub Intro Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vlFw8mo_maauvt0ro8b-DYpHEub8ZeY82qEkbexBe14/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Git/GitHub Demo (Repo)](https://github.com/r0m3c/TTP_2023_Git_Basics)
- **Git/GitHub Assignment (Breakout rooms - 5)**
    - **Description**: Now, we will be breaking out in breakout rooms. In the breakout rooms, I want all of you (individually - but working together in case anyone gets stuck), and create two GitHub repositories, alongside custom project folders (opening up in Visual Studio Code) inside of your Projects Folder. For each public repository, connect it to your terminal, and create:
	    - 1 - 3 commits on the main Branch (these commits can be any type of code - but should be descriptive to what you’re doing)
	    - 2 branches (with each 1-2 commits - for each branch) 
		    - pushing the branch to your Repository and creating a pull request for each branch
		    - Merge each branch to your main branch
		    - make sure you “git pull origin main” after merging the two branches in your local repository
    - > More: 
        > - TAs will be in your breakout rooms to help you out during the assignment
        > - As soon as everyone has completed this assignment (with good understanding of Git and GitHub) we will be moving onto Javascript.
